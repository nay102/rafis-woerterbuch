    introduction: "Learn how German articles identify noun gender, number, and whether something is specific or general.",
    overview: "German uses definite articles (der, die, das) and indefinite articles (ein, eine). Their forms change according to gender, number, and grammatical case, so articles should always be learned together with their nouns.",
    points: [["Learn nouns together", "Memorize der Tisch, die Lampe, and das Buch—not the noun alone."], ["Definite vs. indefinite", "Use a definite article for something known and an indefinite article when introducing something new."], ["Watch the case", "Article endings change when the noun functions as subject, direct object, or indirect object."]],

    points: [["Choose the correct person", "Match the pronoun to the speaker, listener, or person being discussed."], ["Respect formal Sie", "Formal Sie is capitalized and uses the same verb form as sie (they)."], ["Match the case", "Use forms such as mich, mir, dich, and dir according to the pronoun's function."]],

    title: "Verb Conjugation", type: "Grammar", icon: "fa-solid fa-rotate", focus: "Verb forms and tense", time: "30-40 minutes",
    introduction: "Build accurate German sentences by matching verb endings to the subject and selecting the appropriate tense.",
